# WeeklyKeystoneTracker

WeeklyKeystoneTracker makes it easy to see what keys you've done this week across all of your characters.


Development Goals:
- âœ… Determine if a player has a Mythic+ Keystone.
- Identify the type of Mythic+ Keystone.
- Store the player's current Mythic+ Keystone information.
- Update the player's stored information upon getting a new Mythic+ Keystone.
- Either:
    - Keep a log of every week's Mythic+ runs.
    - or clear log and show only current week's Mythic+ runs.
- User interface, probably?

Stretch Goals:
- Store loot received in Mythic+ Dungeons.
